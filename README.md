# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game using C++ and QT Creator. This is a single player game. The game has three modes.

1. Easy Mode:
    In this mode of game computer will try to win if there is a winning move for computer.
    
2. Medium Mode:
    At first try to block the wining moves of the human. Otherwise make simple strategy to win in next two moves.

3. Hard Mode:
    In this mode block every wining moves of human. Also the program will try apply every known TicTacToe strategies to win the game.
    

This program is very simple. I have made this as a course project. I did not use backtracking or known algorithms from internet. Coded all the possible strategies which I have learned when playing this game as a kid. I believe I have covered all of the strategies in hard mode. If there is any way to beat the hard mode, please inform me.
